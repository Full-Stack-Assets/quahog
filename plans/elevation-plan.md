# The Narrows — Evaluation & Elevation Plan

## Where the game is today

The Narrows is past the “tech demo” stage and into a **playable open-world crime loop**, but it still reads more like a strong vertical slice than a finished game. Two builds exist:

| Build | Role | Maturity |
|-------|------|----------|
| **`QUAHOG_Web/`** | Reference spec + live deploy ([projectsouthcoast.vercel.app](https://projectsouthcoast.vercel.app)) | Most complete: missions, economy, heat, radio, streaming map, touch controls |
| **`QUAHOG_GODOT1/`** | Active ship target (Godot 4.6 Web/mobile) | Solid port: real OSM map, drive/fight/jobs, day/night, big map, cheats — but police are **off by default**, missions are thin, and polish gaps remain |

**What works well**

- Real South Coast geography (New Bedford → Fall River corridor)
- Core GTA loop: walk, steal cars, drive, shoot, earn cash, flee heat
- Touch controls + customizable HUD layout
- Day/night, rain, streetlights, radio, minimap, fast travel
- Web build has deeper systems (businesses, mission chain, safehouse, collectibles)

**What holds it back**

1. **Consequence is optional** — Godot defaults `cheat_no_police = true`, so the crime loop has no teeth unless the player finds cheats.
2. **Content depth** — delivery jobs exist; story missions, factions, and character beats from the bible are mostly unbuilt.
3. **World still feels procedural** — buildings are extruded blocks; hero landmarks, interiors, and set dressing are thin.
4. **Juice & audio gaps** — footsteps, horn, headlights, impact polish, district ambience.
5. **No single “north star”** — web and Godot diverge; improvements should land in web first, then port to Godot (per `plans/mount-hope.md`).

---

## Exactly what to do next (prioritized)

These are the highest-leverage moves, in order:

### Tier 1 — Make the loop feel like a real game

1. **Re-enable police/heat by default in Godot** — **DONE** (`cheat_no_police` default `false`; tuned decay/bust/cop damage)
2. **Complete the core crime loop polish** — **DONE**
   - Horn (button + SFX) — `H` + HORN touch button
   - Water as non-drivable barrier — `water_zones.gd` + `water_hazard.gd`
   - Health/armor pickups + cop damage tuning — pickups expanded; cop damage 6
   - Pay-n-Spray / heat clear — `respray_zone.gd` at gun-shop area ($200)
3. **Ship “Off the Boat” opener** — **DONE** (`story_mission.gd`; auto-starts on new game)
4. **Weapon variety on the street** — **DONE** (pistol/bat/shotgun/rifle + ammo pickups)
5. **Smoke-test checklist per build** — **DONE** (`plans/smoke-test-checklist.md`)

### Tier 2 — Make the world believable

6. **Water barrier + drivable bridges** — **DONE** (`water_zones.gd` bridge corridors; `map_loader.gd` deck colliders for Braga, hurricane barrier, Fairhaven).  
7. **Night readability** — **DONE** (facade window emission, car head/taillights, street lamps + mooring lights).  
8. **Traffic & ped life** — **DONE** (stop signs + traffic lights at junctions; ped panic on gunfire; TOD density scaling).  
9. **Hero landmarks** — **DONE** (Lizzie Borden House, Whaling Museum + Battleship Cove polish).  
10. **Audio pass** — **DONE** (harbor ambient loop; footsteps/screech/impacts already wired).

### Tier 3 — Make it memorable (content & identity)

11. **Act I missions** — **DONE** (Auction Rules, Linguiça Run, Harbor Heat in `story_mission.gd`).  
12. **Economy spend loop** — **DONE** (gun shop + Linguiça Linq diner interior with food purchases).  
13. **Coastal Neon style pass** — **DONE** (`neon_signs.gd`; TOD neon lamp energy in `game_world.gd`).  
14. **Radio milestone hooks** — **DONE** (`radio_hooks.gd` autoload; wanted/mission/rain barks).  
15. **Rebrand** — **DONE** (`The Narrows`, 2026 present-day; see `plans/the-narrows.md`).

### Tier 4 — Scale & performance

16. Godot: 200-car pool perf, streaming radius tuning, texture compression — **DONE** (quality presets, staggered car restream, building LOD, tile budget).  
17. Web: LOD/impostors for far buildings, object pooling, quality presets — **DONE** (`quality.ts`, far-tile impostors, pause-menu preset).  
18. Expand map: Brockton, Cape Cod, Dartmouth Mall hub — **DONE** (hero hubs, fast-travel, mall gun shop).

## Recommended execution order

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Fix core loop stakes] --> B[Polish drive/combat feel]
    B --> C[Ship Off the Boat mission]
    C --> D[Night + water + audio pass]
    D --> E[Act I content + economy spend]
    E --> F[Visual identity Coastal Neon]
    F --> G[Scale map + perf]
```

**If you only do five things:**

1. Turn police back on (Godot) and tune heat  
2. Finish “Off the Boat” as the default new-game path  
3. Water barrier + horn + headlights (world reads as a place)  
4. Weapon variety + shops (give cash a purpose)  
5. One focused audio/FX pass (footsteps, screech, harbor ambience)

That sequence turns “impressive sandbox” into “game I’d show someone and they’d understand what The Narrows is.”
