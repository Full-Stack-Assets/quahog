# Mount Hope — Master Plan & Source of Truth

The one file to track everything. Update the **checklist** as work lands and append
to the **running log** every working session. Keep it honest: only check a box when
it's actually built, verified (build passes), and shipped.

- **Working title:** Mount Hope (retired “Project QUAHOG”)
- **Canonical engine:** `QUAHOG_Web/` — Three.js / React Three Fiber + Rapier (web; runs & deploys today). Unity/Godot = legacy reference (`ENGINES.md`).
- **Live:** https://projectsouthcoast.vercel.app · branch `claude/determined-thompson-9jg8o1` → `main` (Vercel auto-deploy)
- **Photoreal experiment:** `QUAHOG_Web/earth.html` (Google 3D Tiles) — blocked on a billed Google key; parked.
- **Design canon:** `quahog-project-files/CHARACTERS_AND_MISSIONS.md`, `GEMINI_BUILD_PROMPT.md`, `ROADMAP.md`.
- **Hard external blocker:** AAA console release needs Sony/Microsoft registered-dev + devkits (a business/legal step, not buildable here).

Legend: `[x]` done & shipped · `[~]` partial/in progress · `[ ]` not started.
Everything below is scoped to be **achievable in the web engine** unless marked *(parked/external)*.

## Working loop (how this plan gets executed)

Repeat this loop every working cycle. One task (or one small coherent batch) at a
time; keep the build green; be honest about status.

1. **READ** — open this file. Skim the checklist + the latest running-log entry.
   Pick the **next task**: highest-priority unchecked `[ ]` (or resume a `[~]`),
   respecting dependencies and any current user-chosen focus. Prefer order:
   foundations → core systems → content → aesthetics/polish, unless redirected.
2. **SCOPE** — restate the task + its acceptance criteria (use the task's intricate
   spec/sub-bullets as the definition of done). Mark it `[~]` in the checklist.
3. **BUILD** — implement it in `QUAHOG_Web/` (code) or `quahog-project-files/` /
   `plans/` (data/docs). Keep changes focused on the task.
4. **VERIFY** — run `npm run build` (tsc + vite) until clean. Sanity-check
   behavior/intent. If shippable, deploy (push → Vercel) and confirm the
   deployment is **READY**. Note: WebGL visuals can't be eyeballed here, so verify
   build + logic and flag anything needing the user's eyes.
5. **REVIEW** — self-review against the task's spec; check for regressions; confirm
   no console/type errors. If only partly done, keep it `[~]` and note what's left.
6. **CHECK OFF** — set the box to `[x]` (done & shipped) or `[~]` (partial).
   Append a dated bullet to the **running log**: what changed + commit hash +
   any blocker/follow-up.
7. **COMMIT & PUSH** — commit on the feature branch, fast-forward `main`, push
   (Vercel auto-deploys). Update task counts if helpful.
8. **REPEAT** — go to step 1.

**Rules of the loop**
- Never leave the build broken between cycles.
- Don't check a box until it's actually built + verified + shipped.
- Record blockers explicitly (e.g., needs a key/asset/user decision) and skip to
  the next unblocked task rather than stalling.
- Batch only tightly-related tasks; otherwise one at a time for clean history.
- The user can interrupt to re-prioritize at any point; honor it, then resume the loop.

## 0. Foundations & ops
- [x] Repo + branch workflow; Vercel project + git auto-deploy (`projectsouthcoast`)
- [x] Engine reconciliation: R3F canonical; Unity/Godot marked legacy
- [x] Game named **Mount Hope**
- [x] Design docs: README, ROADMAP, Characters & Missions bible, Gemini build spec
- [x] CI: typecheck/build check on PRs — `.github/workflows/web-ci.yml` runs `tsc && vite build` on PRs/pushes touching `QUAHOG_Web` (uses `npm install`; lockfile drifts from package.json — `@vercel/blob` missing from the lock)
- [~] Bundle code-splitting — `vite.config` `manualChunks` splits three / @react-three / rapier / react into long-lived vendor chunks; earth is already its own entry (lazy-load of the earth route still open)
- [x] Asset loading/preload screen + progress bar — `loadSlice` streams the slice JSON and reports 0..1; StartMenu shows a progress bar + `LOADING NEW BEDFORD · NN%`
- [x] Error boundary + crash overlay on the main game — `ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx` wraps `<App>` in `main.tsx` (recoverable overlay + reload + build stamp)
- [~] Versioning / changelog; **build stamp in-game (commit hash, build date) — done** (HUD bottom-left, injected by vite define); changelog still open
- [x] Analytics-free telemetry stub (FPS, load time) behind a debug flag — `ui/DebugStats.tsx`, off by default (`?debug` / localStorage / backtick toggle)

## Running log

### 2026-06-21
- Pulled OSM data (New Bedford + Fall River); produced GeoJSON/PMTiles/OBJ + MapLibre viewer; baked the web slice blockout (1071 buildings, 808 roads, harbor).
- Reconciled engines → **R3F canonical**; Unity (PR #18) + Godot legacy; ported StreetLife + car tuning.
- Locked **real names + original characters**; chose **New Bedford waterfront** opener.
- Built the web vertical slice: third-person walk + drivable car + Rapier collision on the real grid; deployed to Vercel via git integration.
- Named the game **Mount Hope**; modeled **Seamen’s Bethel**; spawn in front of it.
- Stylized-realism pass: harbor ocean, daytime sky, textured ground/roads, highways; expanded slice.
- Added **radio** (4 stations, TTS hosts, procedural music, switching/mute).
- Wrote **Characters & Missions bible** and the **Gemini build spec** (AAA console+PC framing, all canon).
- Photoreal **Google 3D Tiles** build (`earth.html`) with full play world + signing proxy — **blocked by Google billing/quota**; parked.
- Pivoted to make the **stylized web game canonical**; folded in **rigged human model**, **radio**, and a **signed Static Maps proxy** for satellite ground (needs Vercel env vars).
- Gameplay pass: **real car models** (player + traffic), **melee combat** (F → KO/kill), **1st/3rd-person toggle** (V), **clouds + planes**; HUD controls updated.
- Created `plans/mount-hope.md` as source of truth, then **expanded it** into a full essential-systems + aesthetics/art-direction/game-feel checklist.
- Added **Part II — World Detail Atlas**: intricate per-city mapping & aesthetic tasks — road/paving system, intersections & signage, modular building/façade kit, NE residential typologies (triple-deckers, mansions, Cape cottages), storefronts & signage, granite mills/churches/civic, ocean & working-waterfront detail, the **inter-city highway network (I-195, MA-24, US-6, MA-18)**, hero **bridges (Braga/“Verde”, Fairhaven, Sagamore/Bourne)**, per-city aesthetic packs (NB/FR/Brockton/Cape), and major systems upgrades (typology classifier, procedural city-gen, navmesh, streaming/LOD, living economy).
- Added **Part III — System Detail Atlases**: exhaustive **vehicle atlas** (the 1980s market by category, fictionalized for ship), plus **character**, **elevated pedestrian-AI**, **interiors**, **weapons**, **clothing/wardrobe**, and **radio & VO** atlases — the radio/VO atlas specifies an **ElevenLabs** pipeline (server-proxied key, subtitles, per-host/character voices, more stations, ads/news/music).
- Added the **Working loop** process (read → scope → build → verify → review → check off → log → commit → repeat) as the canonical execution protocol.
- **Execution batch (+10 items, recommended order):** ① `Props.tsx` — instanced street furniture (lamp posts, hydrants, mailboxes, benches) along road edges (§7); ② lamp-head + building **lit-window glow** ramping at night (§4); ③ **camera FOV scales with car speed** (§13); ④ `SkidMarks.tsx` tire-mark decals on hard cornering (§13); ⑤ **camera shake** (melee + speed via `addShake`) + **low-health damage vignette** (§23); ⑥ `Minimap.tsx` player-centered **radar** (roads/water/objective/heading) (§21); ⑦ `Rain.tsx` + storm grade/closer fog, **R** toggles rain (§5); ⑧ `HarborProps.tsx` — dock pilings + bobbing buoys/fishing boats on the OSM shoreline (§6); ⑨ instanced **street trees** (§7); ⑩ `PauseMenu.tsx` — **Esc/P pause** (resume/view/weather/reset) freezing player/car/time (§26). Added `shared.carSpeed/skid/shake` + `store.ts` weather/paused/slice. Shipped (`d238002`).
- **Execution batch (§32/§3/§4/§15/§16):** rewrote `Roads.tsx` into a 3-class surface system (highway w/ lane markings · asphalt streets · historic granite cobblestone via new `makeCobbleTexture`); added `Effects.tsx` (bloom + vignette + SMAA) + **ACES tone mapping**; added `DayNight.tsx` (600 s day/night cycle driving sun/hemisphere/ambient/fog/bg + drei `<Stars>` + **Palmer’s Island lighthouse beam**); added `game.ts` **PlayerWallet + dual-axis Heat/Wanted** (police + faction 0–5, decay) with `GameSystems.tsx` autosave/load; added `mission.ts` + `MissionRunner.tsx` **mission engine** with a 3-step playable **“Off the Boat”** opener (Bethel → steal car → safehouse) + objective beam/ring marker; HUD gained cash/clock/stars/health panel + objective banner. Shipped (`39ece9e`, `80a05b8`).

- **Player-request batch (UX/driving/map/mobile):** ① collapsible **radio menu** + new **character menu** (outfit-colour tint applied live to the player model) with launcher buttons (§9/§22); ② **inverted A/D** on-foot strafing (§10); ③ **large map** screen — full-screen pannable/zoomable, real OSM **street-name labels**, water, player heading + objective (BigMap.tsx, M), plus **3D street-name signs** in-world (StreetSigns.tsx) (§21/§33); ④ **faster + smoother driving** (top speed 22→44, speed-scaled steering, removed the continuous camera speed-shake that caused the "shaky/bumpy" feel) and **vehicle combat/theft** — ram a traffic car to stop it, **carjack** it on foot (E) with model/colour swap + heat (§12/§13); ⑤ **touch controls** — on-screen thumb-stick + action buttons for phones (TouchControls.tsx, coarse-pointer only) (§25). Shipped (`1800e75`, `91a9e50`, `0aee2eb`).

- **"Heat has teeth" batch:** added **gunplay** — G draws a pistol, click/Space fires a hitscan along the aim with tracer + muzzle flash (Tracers.tsx), dropping peds and damaging cops (§11); **police pursuit** — cop cars spawn and escalate with the police-heat axis, home in with a flashing lightbar, drain health on contact and arrest the player on foot, and are shootable for a payout (Police.tsx, §14); the **busted/wasted** loop — black-out → cash penalty → heat cleared → respawn at the Bethel (Consequence.tsx, §15); a **safehouse** zone that bleeds off heat and autosaves (Safehouse.tsx, §15); and dynamic **vehicle head/tail/brake lights** (dusk + braking, §12). Shipped (`d8884af`).

- **"World reacts" batch:** pedestrians now **flee/panic** from gunfire, melee, and oncoming fast cars (shared.alarm threat model, StreetLife §14); **impact particles** — pooled blood/dust bursts at every melee + gun hit (Impacts.tsx §23); an **aiming reticle** appears when the pistol is drawn (§11/§21); and **parked cars** line the curbs near the core (ParkedCars.tsx §7/§12). Shipped (`34967af`).

- **Audio + police-fairness batch:** procedural **SFX** (gunshot, punch, car crunch, horn-H, cash/UI/bust stings), a **speed-tracked engine note**, a **police siren**, and a **harbor wind + gull ambience** bed (audio/sfx.ts §19/§20/§13). Reworked **police** to be fair (chase at 3★+, slower/fewer units, spawn a few streets away, **losable**, no accidental kills, **5 s arrest grace**) and fixed the **busted/wasted respawn** → BUSTED to the **police station**, WASTED to the **hospital** (places.ts §14/§15). Added **cop blips + police-station markers** to the minimap and big map, and made the **touch controls drag-to-move + resizable** with persisted layout plus gun/fire buttons (§21/§25). Hook false-positive removed (option A). Shipped (`ef1a38e`, `d8fe418`).

- **30-item goal run:** across several batches — **economy** (5 buyable fronts + passive revenue, economy.ts §15/§17); **feel** (Shift sprint+stamina, Space handbrake/drift, chromatic-aberration + film-grain post, on-screen objective distance §10/§13/§3/§21); **weather/ocean/streets** (fog state + wet roads + ocean swell + cycling traffic signals §5/§6/§7); **UI/meta** (title/start screen, pause **settings** with effects+volume, **toast** notifications §22/§26/§21); **combat/side-content** (weapon switching + **shotgun** spread, hidden **scrimshaw** collectibles, **flyer/poster** boards §11/§18/§8). Also reworked police fairness + busted/wasted respawn and added the procedural **SFX/ambience** engine (sfx.ts). Hook false-positive removed (option A). Shipped across `ef1a38e`→`HEAD`.

- **Direction adjust + Step 1 (world build-out):** per user, dropped the planned combat-depth section and refocused the next roadmap on **world rendering + inter-city highways + surrounding towns (Dartmouth, Fairhaven, Westport) → Fall River**. Added in-world **St. Luke's Hospital** stand-in (WASTED respawn) + hospital/police **map markers** on the minimap and big map. **Re-pulled a larger New Bedford slice** via Overpass (waterfront→downtown: **7,645 buildings / 1,753 roads**, up from ~1,071), taught `make_slice.py` to capture civic landmarks, and **re-anchored the police station to the real downtown NBPD footprint** (hospital follows when the pull widens west to St. Luke's). ElevenLabs (key→`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` env) + gamepad (native API) links handed to the user. Shipped (`d6eda37`, `5e2383d`).

- **Perf → radio depth → Dartmouth (ordered batch):** ① **Perf pass** — far buildings chunked into a 160 m grid with automatic frustum culling + a 1050 m distance cull and no shadow casting, so the now-16k-building world stays interactive (Buildings.tsx §29). ② **Radio depth** — ad/ident/news rotation + hosts reacting to **wanted level** and **weather**, on top of ~4× longer host scripts (radioEngine §19); ElevenLabs VO pipeline (proxy + client) wired to all four hosts with Web-Speech fallback (§33), Iron Mike=Shaun-Boston + Buddy voices recorded. ③ **Step 16 Fairhaven** (+ elevated Acushnet bridges) and **Step 17 Dartmouth** (Route 6 corridor) pulled into the slice — now **New Bedford · Fairhaven · Dartmouth**, 16,252 buildings / 3,868 roads (mapgen now sends a User-Agent to beat the Overpass WAF). Shipped (`66e8fbc`→`f8cd5cc`).

- **Step 19 + music + Phase 1 aesthetics + ocean barrier:** ① **multi-tile building streaming** (public/tiles/, 500 m tiles loaded by distance + per-tile colliders; main slice 3.5 MB→849 KB) — unblocks whole-region build-out. ② **Legitimate music** — radio plays real MP3 tracks per station (ElevenLabs Music generator scripts/gen_music.py) with synth fallback. ③ **Phase 1 aesthetics** — STYLE_GUIDE.md; **façade window kit** (procedural per-floor windows, day glass + night-lit, colour by use/height); **shadows follow the player** across the map. ④ **Ocean** — wave-wash ambience everywhere + **water is now a barrier** (sink/recover, Hazards.tsx) so bridges are the required crossing; bridges lowered to a drivable at-grade causeway on pilings. ⑤ Removed the gull-cry **squeak**. Shipped (`25db5fa`→`a4d903b`).

- **Drivable bridges + Sconticut/boats:** ① **drivable elevated bridges** (Bridges.tsx stitches OSM bridge ways into spans, ramps grade→7 m crest→grade with a trimesh collider + piers). ② Fixed the **floating hospital** placeholder. ③ Extended the slice SE down **Sconticut Neck → West Island/Long Island** (36k buildings / 398 tiles, slice still 1.79 MB). ④ **Off the Hook Bar and Grill** purchasable at 56 Goulart Memorial Dr, doubling as the boat dock. ⑤ **Pilotable yacht** (Boat.tsx — board with E, drive on water, exempt from the water barrier) + moored-yacht **Marina** at Long Island (wealthy area = yachts; NB harbor keeps trawlers). Noted **Dartmouth Mall** as a hub for the Fall River push. Shipped (`d065234`→`dd0bcbd`).

- **Phase 2 + 3 visual:** **IBL** (procedural PMREM env → real reflections/ambient on glass, wet roads, cars, water), asphalt **normal maps**, **Gerstner ocean** (multi-wave + reflective); **time-of-day colour grade** (warm dusk / cool night), a **sun-glow** sprite (bloom haze), **coastal-neon dusk signs** on every business front. Shipped (`108402d`, `af4771c`).

- **Region build-out → Fall River:** stopped tracking the raw OSM dump (gitignore) to keep the repo lean, then extended the slice west along the **I-195 / Route 6 corridor** through **Westport** and on to **Fall River + the Charles M. Braga Jr. Memorial Bridge** (drivable). Region now **68,482 buildings / 16,167 roads / 954 streamed tiles** (slim slice 4.2 MB); pulls done incrementally and merged (dedupe by id) to stay within Overpass limits. Shipped (`793e0c4`→`25abda5`).

- **Roads perf → heroes → Phase 2 cont:** ① **road chunking** — roads split into 1000 m cells with frustum + 1500 m distance culling (Roads.tsx) instead of one always-drawn 16k-road mesh. ② **Hero landmarks** (Heroes.tsx) — stylized **USS Massachusetts** at Battleship Cove, the **Lizzie Borden House**, and the **Dartmouth Mall** hub (also a purchasable front), on real coords. ③ **Phase 2 storefront awnings** — instanced two-tone awnings along commercial frontages near the core. Shipped (`788dac5`→`3778469`).

- **Region fixes + fast travel:** ground enlarged 3 km → 60 km so the whole map has land+collider (no more floating Fall River/voids); **water lifted clear of the ground** so it's visible in 3D (was map-only) + brighter teal; **bridge railings**; **fast travel** from the big map (M) to town centers + hero spots; the **Braga Bridge** now reads green (rails + truss towers). Shipped (`f5ccbeb`→`0293104`).

- **Stack fix + Phase 2 street detail:** fixed road **z-fight flicker / "floating"** (ground top moved to y=0 below the roads), capped DPR for framerate, fast travel now brings your car; then Phase 2 — **sidewalk/curb aprons** framing every street, **rooftop clutter** (water tanks/AC) on mid-rises, and **crosswalks** at intersections. Shipped (`8c9648f`→`472af59`).

- **"Next 50" grind (part 1, ~16 items):** rolling **wheels** on all vehicles (§12); **footsteps + foot-dust** (§20/§23); **gamepad** support (§25/§47); **reduce-shake** toggle (§25); off-screen **waypoint arrow** (§21); **mission chain** — Off the Boat → Linguiça Run → Spindle City (§16); out-of-combat **health regen** (§11); **wanted-up sting** (§23); context **enter prompts** (boat/car/steal, §21); **settings persistence** (§26); **pause stats** screen (§22); denser **pedestrians + traffic that yields** to the player (§14); **UI sfx** on menus (§20); **utility poles + wires** (§7). Shipped (`57e1334`→`9325ed9`).

- **"Next 50" grind (part 2, ~5 items):** adaptive **chase-music duck** under police heat (§19); ground **grime/oil decals** (§32); **street race** side activity with checkpoints + best time (§18); title-screen **New Game / Continue** (§22). Shipped (`ea67a17`→`b79e06c`).

- **"Next 50" grind (part 3, ~3 items):** harbor **gulls** + **photo mode** (O, cinematic orbit, HUD hidden); **radio subtitles** — the dial now captions the currently spoken host/ad line in the active host's name (radioEngine `onSubtitle` → HUD §33); **custom map waypoint** — right-click the big map to drop a pink pin, the HUD shows a pink bearing arrow + distance to it, clear via the 📍 button (BigMap/HUD/shared §21). Shipped (`1c53cd0`→`a8f1ddd`).

- **"Next 50" grind (part 4, +1):** **owned-front rest perk** — standing on foot inside a front you own now heals you fast (≈12/s) and bleeds off police + faction heat (a payoff for buying property), with a one-time "Resting at …" toast (Businesses §15). Shipped (`a8f1ddd`→`ac13bf1`).

- **"Next 50" grind (part 5, +1):** **traffic obeys red lights** — TrafficLights now publishes its signal stop-lines to `shared.stopZones` with a live red flag (red + amber = stop); ambient traffic halts when a red stop-line is just ahead (≤8 m) and aligned with its travel direction, so cross-street cars ignore it and cars queue behind each other (StreetLife `redAhead`, §14). Shipped (`ac13bf1`→`5038695`).

- **"Next 50" grind (part 6, +2):** **waypoint on the radar** — the player-placed waypoint now shows as a pink dot on the minimap, clamped to the radar ring when off-range (Minimap §21); **waypoint auto-clear** — driving/walking within 9 m of it clears the pin with a "Waypoint reached" toast (GameSystems §21). Shipped (`5038695`→`5115727`).

- **"Next 50" grind (part 7, +1):** **baseball bat melee** — key **4** equips a bat (key **1** back to bare fists); the bat reaches farther (2.8 m), hits harder, and knocks pedestrians flying with a heavier camera punch; it renders in the player's hand and reads on the HUD as 🏏 BAT (store `melee`, GameSystems, Player, HUD §10/§11). Shipped (`5115727`→`3783f51`).

- **"Next 50" grind (part 8, +1):** **scrimshaw counter** — the hidden-collectible tally is now a persistent HUD readout (🦴 n/8), reactive via `store.scrimshaw`, seeded from the save on load and bumped on pickup (Collectibles/store/HUD §18). Shipped (`3783f51`→`74eebc9`).

- **"Next 50" grind (part 9, +1):** **traffic brake lights** — ambient cars now flare their taillights whenever they're halted (red light, yielding to the player, or freshly rammed) via the existing Vehicle `brake` getter, so a queue at a red reads correctly at night (StreetLife §12). Shipped (`74eebc9`→`c9a56f3`).

- **"Next 50" grind (part 10, +2):** **ragdoll launch** — pedestrians struck by the bat (or run over by a car at speed) are now flung along the blow, tumbling through the air with gravity + spin before settling, instead of just flopping flat; running someone over also registers a hit + draws heat once (StreetLife §14/§23). **Wall graffiti** — colourful procedural spray tags (`makeGraffiti`) on upright quads set back from the street where walls are, facing the road, near-core only (Graffiti.tsx §32). Shipped (`c9a56f3`→`e03fabd`).

- **Code-review fixes (batches Q–X):** ran a high-effort 8-angle review of the grind and fixed the real bugs it surfaced. ① **Red-light coordinate bug** — TrafficLights published stop-line bearings from un-negated OSM northing while `redAhead` compared world-space car headings, so cars ran reds (and cross-traffic stopped at green) on diagonal roads; bearing now computed in world space. ② **New Game wasn't fresh** — migrated `waypoint` into the zustand store (deleting BigMap's `force()` re-render hack) and added `useGame.resetSession()` so New Game clears bat/photo/armed/scrimshaw/waypoint; `Collectibles` is now keyed on a `gameId` so its picked-up ref re-reads the wiped save. ③ **Bat wasn't lethal** — hit-resolution now advances one stage per damage point, so a 2-damage blow (bat/gun/car) drops a standing ped outright while a fist only knocks down (also kills the run-over jitter/2-frame-kill). ④ **Ragdoll launch classifier** — "hard" fling now keys off the hit amount, not push magnitude, so point-blank run-overs and gunshots fling correctly (pistol now sets a launch push). ⑤ **Melee/gun mismatch** — F is a pistol-whip (not a bat strike) while a gun is drawn. Build green. Shipped (`e03fabd`→`c04cf3a`).

- **Cleanup (review §9/§10):** extracted the shared road-edge sampler `roadSamples.ts` (`sampleRoadEdges`) — the iterate-roads / skip-bridge / highway-whitelist / arc-length walk / sparse / radius-cull loop now lives in one place; `Decals` and `Graffiti` both call it and add their own jitter / perpendicular offset. `Graffiti` now buckets tags straight into per-variant arrays (dropped the redundant `byVariant` filter pass + the `v` field). Shipped (`c04cf3a`→`f786212`).

- **Grind Y/Z + player fixes:** **position-save Continue** — the player's spot/mode/car persist (20 s autosave + pagehide) and resume on Continue; New Game wipes the key (GameSystems §26). **Speedometer** MPH readout while driving + **Pay-n-Spray** at the Anvil Garage (drive in with heat → $200 respray clears the wanted level + repaints, Respray.tsx §14). **Player report:** raised the **Braga Bridge** ~10 ft (green span now crests at 10 m with a 40 m ramp so it stays drivable, lifting it clear of the approach roads); reduced the **"squished roads"** at the I-195 interchange — trimmed highway carriageway width to 0.82× so the close divided carriageways read as separate roads with a median, plus polygon-offset on road materials to kill the overlap z-fight (Bridges/Roads). Shipped (`f786212`→`ce…`).

- **Audio/radio pipeline + content:** fixed host VO (built-in premade voices per character so none fall silent; a per-voice failure no longer disables all VO). Added the **music drop-in system** — `scripts/gen_manifests.mjs` (auto-run via pre/dev/build) + `MusicPlayer.tsx` + a **webhook receiver** (`/api/music-webhook` → Vercel Blob) and `/api/music`; the radio reads Blob → static manifest → synth, and the in-game radio shows **now-playing + skip** on music stations. Wrote `radio-scripts.md` (host VO, songs w/ lyrics, jingles). 

- **"Next 50" grind (parts AA–GG):** **cash drops** from downed peds (Pickups); **HUD compass** + **tire-screech** sfx; **pedestrian barks** on melee; **Quit-to-title** in the pause menu; **vehicle damage + engine smoke** (resets on respray/carjack); **respawning health packs**; **near-miss driving cash bonus**; **pause-menu controls reference**; **"EVADED" cash reward** for losing the cops. Shipped (`…`→HEAD).

### 2026-06-22 — DIRECTION CHANGE: perfect New Bedford first
Per the user: **stop all city/region expansion. Make the New Bedford core genuinely good before going anywhere else.** Fall River / Westport / Dartmouth / the bridges stay in the slice but are not the focus; no new regions get pulled until NB is "perfect."
- Fixed the blocker: Vercel **install command** was `node install` → every deploy failed at install; overridden to `npm install` in `vercel.json`. Deploys live again at projectsouthcoast.vercel.app.
- Wired uploaded audio: Maré Alta plays 3 real songs; The Rage plays jingles.
- **Rendering pass:** sRGB colorspace on all procedural textures (fixes washed-out look), anisotropy ×16, 256px asphalt, building façade normal-relief, shadow bias.
- **"New Bedford to perfection" checklist (open):**
  - [~] Buildings: era/material variety (brick mills, granite downtown, triple-deckers), height + roofline variation, less "extruded box" look — short footprints (<14 m) now get **peaked hip roofs** (apex-fan over the centroid; tall granite/mills stay flat); era/material variety still TODO
  - [ ] Streets: surfaces, intersections, curbs/sidewalks, signage, parked density
  - [ ] Lighting/atmosphere: ambient occlusion, color grade, fog, reflections
  - [ ] Waterfront: piers, working docks, boats, hurricane barrier, water quality
  - [ ] Landmarks: Seamen's Bethel + downtown accuracy, hero buildings

### 2026-06-24 — NB rooflines + favicon
- **Peaked roofs (less "extruded box"):** `StreamingBuildings.tsx` now caps short
  footprints (`height < 14 m`) with a peaked hip roof — a triangle fan from each
  footprint edge to a single apex over the centroid (pitch ≈ steep 35-45° on
  house/triple-decker widths, capped at 5.5 m so wide blocks don't spike). Tall
  granite-downtown + brick mills keep realistic flat roofs; heroes untouched;
  rooftop water-tank/AC clutter moved to flat-roofed buildings only. Found +
  fixed a backface-culling bug (fan winding faced down → roofs invisible behind
  the flat extrude cap); winding now derived from the footprint's signed area in
  world XZ so it's robust to OSM orientation. Verified deterministically (merged
  geometry max-Y rises above walls, roof normals face up) and visually in photo
  mode (incl. a magenta debug pass to confirm the peak shape). Added an inline
  SVG favicon (kills the `favicon.ico` 404). Shipped (`b64ddac`).
