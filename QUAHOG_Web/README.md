# South Coast — Web 3D Vertical Slice

Working title: **Project QUAHOG** (name TBD). The browser-playable engine slice
for an original open-world game set on the real Massachusetts South Coast.

This is the **plan-agnostic engine slice** (Step 3): third-person walk, car
enter/drive, collision, on the real **New Bedford waterfront** street grid +
auto-extruded building blockout pulled from OpenStreetMap.

## Stack

Three.js · React Three Fiber · @react-three/rapier (physics/collision) ·
zustand · Vite + TypeScript. 100% web — no native build step.

## Run

```sh
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # type-check + production bundle to dist/
npm run preview  # serve the production build
```

## Controls

| Key | On foot | Driving |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `W A S D` / arrows | walk (camera-relative) | throttle / steer / brake |
| `E` | steal/enter the car (when near) | exit the car |

The chase camera eases behind whichever actor is active.

## What's in the slice

- **Real street grid** — 561 OSM road centerlines (Johnny Cake Hill, William /
  Union / Water St, MacArthur Dr…) rendered as flat ribbons.
- **Building blockout** — 316 OSM footprints auto-extruded with per-building
  convex-hull colliders (the "graybox" world-building technique).
- **Landmarks** — 15 named POIs with floating labels; the five **hero** buildings
  (Seamen's Bethel, Whaling Museum, Mariner's Home, Double Bank Building, Rodman
  Candleworks) are gold with neon marker beams, ready for hand-detailing.
- **Street life** — ambient kinematic pedestrians wandering the district plus
  decorative traffic that drives the real road network (ported from the legacy
  Unity `StreetLife.cs`).
- **Coastal Neon** starter look — dusk key light + harbor fog.

## Data

The world loads `public/slice-newbedford.json` — a slice-local blockout (origin
= bbox center, meters; `x` = east, `z` = -north, `y` = up). It's generated from
OpenStreetMap by
[`../quahog-project-files/mapdata/make_slice.py`](../quahog-project-files/mapdata/make_slice.py)
(raw pull: `nb_slice.osm.json`). To re-pull/re-bake, see the mapdata README.

## Not yet (next slice work)

Hand-detailed Seamen's Bethel, fish-pier ambush mission scaffold, weather +
friction, audio, smarter pedestrian/traffic AI (collision avoidance, traffic
signals). The project name still needs to change off "Quahog" (seeds:
Quequechan, Spindle City, Mount Hope).
