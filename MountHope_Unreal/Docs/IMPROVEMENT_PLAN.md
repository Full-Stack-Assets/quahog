# Mount Hope Unreal — Improvement Plan

This document captures the current state of `MountHope_Unreal/`, the gaps
identified during exploration, and the phased plan to reach a playable
vertical slice.

## Current state (before this pass)

`MountHope_Unreal/` was an early C++ scaffold (~500 lines) with:

- Thin stubs for player, vehicle, missions, economy, and world metadata
- No `Target.cs` files (first compile required editor project generation)
- Empty `Content/` and a default map (`MH_VerticalSlice`) that does not exist
- Legacy input bindings despite Enhanced Input being enabled
- No JSON bootstrap, save/load, or mission trigger loop
- No CI; only `Scripts/validate_scaffold.py` for structural checks

A parallel tree at `QUAHOG_Unreal/` had more complete framework code (JSON
loading, mission triggers, save game) but is not listed in `README.md` /
`ENGINES.md` as the canonical PC track.

## Gaps vs. vertical-slice acceptance criteria

From `Docs/VERTICAL_SLICE.md`:

| Criterion | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Graybox level with OSM roads/water | Needs editor assets |
| Walk third-person on roads | C++ ready; needs map + pawn mesh |
| Enter/exit Chaos vehicle | C++ possession loop implemented |
| Drive on roads | Needs vehicle mesh + wheel setup |
| Mission NPC + short crime mission | JSON campaign + trigger actors wired |
| Earn/spend money | `MHGameStateSubsystem` + businesses JSON |
| Dialogue exchanges | `UMHDialogueSubsystem` + `MHDialogueNpcActor` + JSON |
| OSM slice data loaded at runtime | `MHWorldSliceSubsystem` loads web slice JSON |
| Cinematic Lumen/Nanite lighting | Config defaults set; needs content |

## Improvements delivered in this pass

### Build & CI

- `Source/MountHope.Target.cs` and `Source/MountHopeEditor.Target.cs`
- `Scripts/build.sh` — wraps `RunUBT.sh` when `UE_ROOT` is set locally
- `.github/workflows/unreal-ci.yml` — runs `validate_scaffold.py` on PRs

### Framework (C++)

- `UMHGameInstance` — bootstraps slice, missions, economy, and save slot on startup
- `UMHWorldSliceSubsystem` — loads `slice-newbedford.json` at runtime
- `UMHMissionSubsystem` — JSON campaign with step advancement
- `UMHGameStateSubsystem` — cash, heat, weather, businesses, save/load
- `AMHMissionTriggerActor` — world-target objective volumes
- `AMHGameModeBase` — mission loop, heat decay, trigger refresh
- `AMHPlayerCharacter` — vehicle enter/exit + interact
- `UMHEconomySubsystem` — thin delegate to game state (backward compatible)

### Data

- `Data/Missions/vertical_slice.json`
- `Data/Economy/businesses.json`

### Validation

- Expanded `Scripts/validate_scaffold.py` to cover targets, JSON schemas,
  config wiring, mission/vehicle helpers, and deprecated-macro guards.

## Second pass — GTA-structure gameplay loop, canonical storyline, radio

This pass wired up systems that existed as orphaned scaffolding (never spawned
or read by anything) into real gameplay loops, and replaced the two-mission
placeholder campaign with the canonical Acts I–III + Gloria finale storyline
sourced from `QUAHOG_GODOT1/scripts/systems/story_mission.gd` (the most
complete story-mission implementation across the Godot/Web tracks — see
`ENGINES.md`/`QUAHOG_Unreal/LEGACY.md` for track history). `QUAHOG_Unreal/`
(the legacy UE bootstrap) was checked for anything not already merged forward;
its data files are byte-identical to `MountHope_Unreal/`'s and its C++ is a
strict subset (no damage model, no `IMHInteractable`, weaker character), so
nothing further was ported from it.

### Police/wanted loop (previously orphaned)

- `UMHWantedSubsystem` (`WorldSubsystem`) now decays heat over time
  (`TickWantedDecay`, driven from `AMHGameModeBase::Tick`) and broadcasts
  `OnWantedLevelChanged`. `AMHVehiclePawn` reports `PropertyDamage` crimes on
  high-speed collisions with other pawns; mission steps can flag `"crime"`
  with a `"crimeSeverity"`; `AMHSafehouseActor` clears wanted state on save.
- HUD shows a 5-star wanted readout (`UMHGameHudWidget::SetWantedText`).

### Reputation loop (previously orphaned)

- `UMHReputationSubsystem` is now read/written by mission steps
  (`"reputationFaction"` / `"reputationDelta"`) and by `AMHShopActor` (garage
  repair discount when reputation with `Faction.Business.Garage` is high
  enough). New faction tags for the expanded campaign: `Faction.Crew.FallRiver`,
  `Faction.Sports.Boxing`, `Faction.Elite.CapeCod`.

### Vehicle damage & repair

- `AMHVehiclePawn` gained `Health`/`MaxHealth`, `ApplyVehicleDamage`,
  `RepairVehicle`, `GetHealthPercent`, `IsWrecked`, and a `NotifyHit` override
  that converts impact impulse into damage and a wanted-heat report. Chaos
  vehicle `Mass`/`DragCoefficient` are tuned for a heavier, less toy-like feel.

### Safehouse, shops, and collectibles (previously missing)

- `AMHSafehouseActor` — interactable save point; persists a spawn location
  (`UMHGameStateSubsystem::SafehouseLocation`) that `AMHGameModeBase` restores
  the player to on the next session, and clears wanted state.
- `AMHShopActor` — `Garage` mode repairs the nearest damaged vehicle for cash;
  `GeneralStore` mode wraps `BuyBusiness` for a purchase interaction.
- `UMHCollectibleSubsystem` + `AMHCollectibleActor` — a JSON-driven "scrimshaw"
  side-content loop (`Data/Collectibles/vertical_slice.json`, 8 items across
  the map), saved/loaded via `UMHGameStateSubsystem`.

### Radio (new)

- `UMHRadioSubsystem` — a JSON-driven station roster
  (`Data/Radio/stations.json`) built from the real station/DJ/song content in
  `quahog-project-files/radio-scripts.md` and the rendered VO/music already in
  `QUAHOG_Web/public/music/`: **WHALE 92.1** (Sully, classic rock), **The
  Rage, 1480 AM** (Buddy Mello, talk), **The Anvil, WBOX** (Iron Mike
  Fontaine — its Brockton rock-anthem bed doubles as foreshadowing for the
  "The Undefeated" mission), **Maré Alta, 105.3** (Tia Conceição, Portuguese/
  Cape Verdean). `R` cycles stations while driving
  (`AMHPlayerCharacter::RequestRadioNextStation`); the HUD shows
  station/song. The subsystem only carries station/song *data* — binding
  actual `USoundWave` assets from the `voFolder`/`jingleFolder` manifest paths
  to a Blueprint audio player is an editor step (see
  `Scripts/editor_bootstrap_vertical_slice.py`'s next-steps output).

### Canonical campaign (replaces the 2-mission placeholder)

`Data/Missions/vertical_slice.json` now has 11 missions matching
`story_mission.gd`'s `MISSIONS` array 1:1 (title, steps, per-step reward,
mission-level `completionReward`, `act` label, `completionMessage`), with
world-space targets converted via the verified `(GodotX, 0, -GodotZ) ->
(UnrealX, 0, UnrealZ)` rule (cross-checked against 3 coordinates shared with
the pre-existing 2-mission data, which matched exactly):

1. **Off the Boat** (Prologue) — New Bedford waterfront opener.
2. **Auction Rules**, **The Linguiça Run**, **Harbor Heat** (Act I — The
   Narrows) — New Bedford crew jobs.
3. **Spindle City**, **Acquitted** (Act II — Spindle City) — Fall River /
   Lady Borden's crew, Battleship Cove and the Borden House.
4. **The Undefeated** (Act II — City of Champions) — Brockton / Iron Mike
   Fontaine at Champion City Gym.
5. **Heritage Marina**, **Compound Interest** (Act III — The Cape) — the Fake
   Kennedys' Hyannis compound.
6. **Gloria**, **Big Mamie** (Finale — Gloria) — the hurricane climax at the
   Hurricane Barrier and the USS Massachusetts at Battleship Cove.

Only New Bedford's core graybox is OSM-imported today; missions past "Harbor
Heat" reference Fall River/Brockton/Cape Cod coordinates that need their own
OSM import or hand-authored blockout before their trigger volumes are
reachable in PIE — see `Scripts/editor_bootstrap_vertical_slice.py`'s
next-steps output.

### Consequence loop, stamina, time-of-day, health pickups

- `UMHGameStateSubsystem::ApplyDamage` now triggers a "wasted" consequence at
  0 HP (cash penalty, full heal, wanted cleared, `OnPlayerWasted`); a sustained
  max wanted level (`AMHGameModeBase::MaxWantedBustedSeconds`, default 25s)
  triggers "busted" the same way via `TriggerBusted`/`OnPlayerBusted`.
  `AMHGameModeBase` binds both delegates and respawns at the safehouse.
- `AMHPlayerCharacter` has a sprint stamina meter (drain while sprinting,
  regen at rest, forces sprint off at 0); shown on the HUD status line.
- `UMHTimeOfDaySubsystem` — a minimal hour clock (`AdvanceTime`, default one
  game-day per 600 real seconds) that modulates `AMHWeatherDirectorActor`'s
  sun intensity day vs. night. Deliberately lightweight — no sky/moon material
  or full day-night blend; see the Godot tracks' `TimeOfDayClock.gd` if a
  fuller cycle is wanted later.
- `AMHHealthPickupActor` — walk-over heal pickup with a respawn cooldown,
  matching the Web track's "green cross" pickups.

Not ported this pass (flagged by research as more involved / Phase 2): a
minimap, pedestrian AI with threat/ragdoll behavior, and any weapon/combat
system.

## Next phases (editor workstation required)

### Phase 1 — First playable in editor

1. Open `MountHope.uproject` in UE 5.6+ and compile (`Scripts/build.sh` or editor).
2. Create `/Game/Maps/MH_VerticalSlice` as an Open World map.
3. Add Blueprint children for `MHPlayerCharacter` and `MHVehiclePawn` with
   placeholder meshes and a Chaos vehicle setup.
4. Place at least one `MHVehiclePawn` in the slice spawn area.
5. PIE: walk, enter vehicle, complete first mission step via trigger volume.

### Phase 2 — World geometry

1. Run `Scripts/editor_import_osm.py` (imports OBJ + slice road splines).
2. Verify scale/collision in viewport; tune bbox caps in the script if needed.
3. Nav mesh bake on imported roads.

### Phase 3 — Enhanced Input migration

Done in C++ (`MHPlayerCharacter` supports Enhanced Input with legacy fallback).
Run `Scripts/editor_create_enhanced_input.py` in the editor to create
`IMC_Default` and Input Action assets.

### Phase 4 — Content & polish

**Implemented in C++:**
- `UMHGameHudWidget` — objective, cash/weather status, dialogue subtitles (binds to `OnDialogueLineChanged`)
- `AMHPlayerController` — creates HUD at runtime; **.** cycles weather (debug)
- `AMHWeatherDirectorActor` — blends fog/sun per `EMHWeatherState`

**Still editor-authored:**
- MetaHuman mesh on `MHDialogueNpcActor`
- Optional `WBP_MHGameHud` via `Scripts/editor_create_hud_widget.py`
- Niagara rain particles for CoastalRain / Nor'easter
- Package Development build via `Scripts/package.sh`
- Meshes for `AMHSafehouseActor` / `AMHShopActor` / `AMHCollectibleActor`,
  `ShopType` + `LinkedBusinessId` on the two placed shops
- Import `USoundWave` assets from `Data/Radio/stations.json`'s
  `voFolder`/`jingleFolder` paths and wire a Blueprint radio player to
  `UMHRadioSubsystem::OnStationChanged` / `OnSongChanged`

### Phase 5 — Repo consolidation

`QUAHOG_Unreal/` is marked **legacy** (`QUAHOG_Unreal/LEGACY.md`). Its framework
patterns live in `MountHope_Unreal/`; do not add new features to the old tree.

## Local compile & package

```bash
export UE_ROOT="/path/to/UE_5.6"
./MountHope_Unreal/Scripts/build.sh

# Package (after editor content exists):
./MountHope_Unreal/Scripts/package.sh
```

See `Docs/EDITOR_SETUP.md` for the Phase 1 editor checklist and
`Scripts/editor_bootstrap_vertical_slice.py` for in-editor automation.

## CI (cloud sandbox)

```bash
python3 MountHope_Unreal/Scripts/validate_scaffold.py
```

Full C++ compile cannot run in Cursor Cloud without a local Unreal install.
